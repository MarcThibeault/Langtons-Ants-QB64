It's been dormant on my system for more than a year, figured I'd put it on here for everyone's enjoyment. Take note that it was developped in French. I translated the Interface, but the variable names are in French. \r\n\r\nQB64: http://www.qb64.net/\r\n\r\n###Features\r\n* 1 to 128 Ants\r\n* Adjust speed using + and - keys\r\n* Various universe sizes in pixels, defaults to 1920x1030\r\n* Default universe is toroidal\r\n* All ants have a unique color and interact with one another\r\n* Live statistics on the left side, see images below. \r\n\r\n###Screenshots\r\n![](http://img.marcthibeault.com/misc/antsqb64-1.png)\r\n![](http://img.marcthibeault.com/misc/antsqb64-1.png)\r\n![](http://img.marcthibeault.com/misc/antsqb64-2.png)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
