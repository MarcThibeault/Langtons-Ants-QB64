##Langton's Ants on Steroids (QB64)

This is a QB64 version of the Langton's Ants I made with a friend as we were messing around with QB64. It's been dormant on my system for more than a year, figured I'd put it on here for everyone's enjoyment. Take note that it was developped in French. I translated the Interface, but the variable names are in French.
